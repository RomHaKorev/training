%## Boy Scout rule
%## code facile a ecrire -> facile a lire
%## Don't be afraid to break things


\begin{frame}{The Boy Scout Rule}
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item Always leave the campground cleaner than you found it. 
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{If it's easy to write, then it's easy to read}
  \begin{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Don't be afraid to break things}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Code versioning: nothing is lost
  \item Nobody cares is something if you break something while you are working on it
  \item Remove the tumour: A healthy limited project will be better than a sick and unstable project
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
